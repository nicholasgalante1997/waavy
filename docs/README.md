# Waavy

A tool for rendering React applications in non javascript server runtimes.

---

## Intro

Waavy isn't a framework, and it doesn't want to be. Waavy is more like a set of adapters that says,

"If you follow these very minimal guidelines we've laid out for you, you can render React pages from wherever you want, without needing to bootstrap a javascript runtime to support it."

So really, it's a set of minimal adapters and patterns that wants you to have more autonomy over your web development patterns with React, and not feel so coerced into modern React web frameworks, which _you never needed_.

## How does it work?
