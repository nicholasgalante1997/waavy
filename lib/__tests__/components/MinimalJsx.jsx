        Why are there so many songs about rainbows? And what's on the other
        side? Rainbows are visions, but only illusions; And rainbows have
        nothing to hide, So I've been told, and some choose to believe it. I
        know they're wrong wait and see. One day we'll find it,
        <i>The Rainbow Connection</i>
        The lovers, the dreamers, and me.
