     * If your application uses react-query, you can opt into server side rendering (prefetching) all your react-query queries here
     * This will help with the initial load time of your application
     * 
     * This makes a couple assumptions, you should be aware of:
     * 
     * 1. This elects to follow the `hydration` pattern of react-query server side rendering/prefetching. It does not use the `initialData` pattern. You can read more about that here https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/ssr#using-the-hydration-apis
     * 
     * 2. As such, it will inject a `dehydratedState` property into the Props made available to your component on the server.
     * 
     * 3. It assumes you will make use of that dehydratedState on the client to populate a `HydrationBoundary` with the data from the server
     * 
     * 4. It assumes you are instatiating a queryClient on the client as a stateful react value, as seen here: 
     * 
     * ```tsx
     * // _app.tsx
     * import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
     * 
     * export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
     * const [queryClient] = React.useState(
     *   () =>
     *   new QueryClient({
     *      defaultOptions: {
     *        queries: {
     *           // With SSR, we usually want to set some default staleTime
     *           // above 0 to avoid refetching immediately on the client
     *           staleTime: 60 * 1000,
     *       },
     *   },
     * }),
     * )    
     *
     * return (
     *    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
     *      <Component {...pageProps} />
     *    </QueryClientProvider>
     *  )
     * 
     * ```
     * 
     * @example
     * 
     * ```json
     * {
     *  tanstackReactQuery: {
     *     prefetch: [
     *      {
     *        queryKey: "user",
     *        queryFn: "./queries/user.ts"
     *      }
     *    ] 
     *  }
     * }
     * ```
     */
  tanstackReactQuery?: {
    prefetch: {
      queryKey: string | string[];
      queryFn: string | { path: string; module: string };
    }[];
  };
};
